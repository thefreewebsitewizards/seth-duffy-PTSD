            <h5>Debbie Snow — Life Coach & Instructor at Life Design Project</h5>
            <p>It's truly inspiring to witness someone like Seth embody the essence of "live it, give it" in the context of life coaching. This principle underscores the importance of personal experience and growth as foundational elements in helping others do the same.</p>
            <p>Seth's dedication to his own self-awareness and development not only enriched his own life but also equipped him with the insight and intuition necessary to guide others on their paths.</p>
            <p>His impact on his fellow students speaks volumes about his commitment to their growth and well-being. Seth's contributions undoubtedly played a significant role in fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.</p>
            <p>By living his truth and sharing his wisdom, he embodies the spirit of "live it, give it" in its purest form.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>I felt really stuck and overwhelmed prior to working together. Now I feel more motivated and I feel like things aren't as impossible as they seem.</li>
              <li>I've had a really great time. I feel comfortable enough to share the areas of my life that I'm insecure about.</li>
              <li>I've negotiated a raise, learned how to set small goals, and feel motivated and inspired.</li>
              <li>Hard time navigating my relationship, job, and finding a purpose.</li>
              <li>I mostly tried self help books and that didn't work well for me.</li>
              <li>The motivation and inspiration I felt after each enabled me to set new goals and discover more about what it is I enjoy doing.</li>

            <h5>Jerry C</h5>
            <p>“How were things before we teamed up, and how are they now?” I felt like before we teamed up I lacked purpose but now I feel better than I ever have and more motivated to teach my goals.</p>
            <p>“How was your journey with me? Were you happy with the experience?” This journey has been great. Seth taught me to keep pushing forward even when I wanted to quit. Great mentorship and coach. I feel more confident which translates to every aspect of my life.</p>
            <p>“Tell me about your results. Any particular highlights?” I’ve gained more muscle and lost fat, I feel more confident which translates to every aspect of my life.</p>
            <p>“Would you recommend me to others?” Absolutely, Get on the Seth plan. I highly recommend it! If you want a more positive outlook on life. Stop waiting.</p>
            <p>“What challenges were you struggling with before we started?” Eating healthy and staying motivated.</p>

            <h5>Morgan P</h5>
            <p>Before teaming up with Seth, I felt lost/uncertain about my direction in life. After just a few sessions, I had clarity, purpose, and next steps for a life I was excited to live, thanks to his guidance and support.</p>
            <p>My journey with Seth was transformative. I couldn’t be happier with the experience. His insightful coaching and encouragement helped me overcome obstacles and achieve my goals. I have formed habits and developed new perspectives to keep me happy/healthy in the long run.</p>
            <p>The results speak for themselves. I’ve experienced significant personal growth, developed a deeper understanding of myself, and successfully pursued my weight loss goals. One highlight was realizing the power of mindset in achieving lasting change. My coaching sessions were not a quick fix, but instead were to help me truly understand myself, and use that as a tool to move forward.</p>
            <p>Absolutely, I would highly recommend Seth to others. His expertise, empathy, and commitment to his clients’ success make him an invaluable resource for anyone seeking positive change in their lives.</p>
            <p>Before starting coaching, I was struggling with motivation, self-doubt, and consistency in my weight loss journey. Seth helped me overcome these challenges by identifying underlying issues and providing practical strategies for success.</p>
            <p>Yes, I had tried various solutions before seeking coaching, but none had provided long-lasting results. Working with Seth allowed me to break through barriers and make sustainable changes that have positively impacted every aspect of my life.</p>
            <p>There were several ‘light bulb’ moments during our sessions, but one that stands out was realizing the connection between my emotions and eating habits. Understanding this link empowered me to develop healthier coping mechanisms and break free from emotional eating patterns.</p>
